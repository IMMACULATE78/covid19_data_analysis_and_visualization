# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker Project

## 📌 Project Description
This project involves analyzing COVID-19 data using the pandas library and visualizing insights with matplotlib and seaborn. The analysis focuses on selected country data and includes trends, distributions, and comparisons of COVID-19 statistics.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and explore a real-world dataset using pandas.
- Perform basic data analysis and identify insights.
- Visualize data trends and relationships using matplotlib and seaborn.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- pandas
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Google Colab (for running the notebook)

## 🚀 How to Run the Project
1. Open the notebook file in Jupyter or Google Colab.
2. Ensure all required libraries (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn) are installed.
3. Run each cell from top to bottom to execute the analysis.

## 🔍 Observations and Reflections
- The dataset included COVID-19 statistics across different dates.
- Some dates had missing or zero values, which were handled appropriately.
- Visualizations like line charts, bar charts, histograms, and scatter plots were used to show data distribution and trends.
- The analysis provided an overview of COVID-19 case growth over time for selected countries.
